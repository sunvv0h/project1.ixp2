    <p style = "margin-bottom: 30px;">In a turn of events, Alicia moved back to her old Beijing home, but still remained at the same school and had the same friends</p>

    <p style = "margin-bottom: 30px;">She mentions that she skipped a day of school during middle school for a reason she'll never regret.</p>

    <blockquote><i>"[I went] to a concert in Guangzhou. I don’t regret it, because that group disbanded after that tour. Looking back, it still feels kind of surreal."</i></blockquote>

    <p>She notes that the internet and its culture helped her discover her hobbies, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Anime</li>
        <li>Games</li>
        <li>Idols</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, admist the self discovery, she found out that what mattered most to her was her art. Additionally, she mentions that she became "more certain" that she wanted to study art.</p>
