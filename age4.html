    <p style = "margin-bottom: 30px;">Alicia moved to Beijing by this point, where she'd started kindergarten and enjoyed a quiet life.</p>

    <blockquote><i>"It wasn’t close to the city center anymore, but it was very peaceful. Life felt simple and relaxed there..."</i></blockquote>

    <p style = "margin-bottom: 30px;">She remembers being much more outgoing compared to today, and did things an outgoing kid would do.</p>

    <p>She notes that she didn't have pets growing up due to a family member's allergies. She'd alleviate this longing by playing with her cousin's dog everyday.</p>
