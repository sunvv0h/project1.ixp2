    <p style = "margin-bottom: 30px;">Due to her increasing amounts of responsibilities (as comes with age), Alicia began to live at home and at school, in a "back and forth" way.</p>

    <blockquote><i>"Life kept switching, and now it’s all kind of a blur."</i></blockquote>

    <p style = "margin-bottom: 30px;">Alicia states that she has a vivid memory involving the summer that year, when she'd experience art student life but more importantly, life outside of China.</p>

    <blockquote><i>"I went to London for a short summer course at UAL. It was my first time experiencing the atmosphere of an art university and trying out life in London. I realized it didn’t suit me that well, but I made some friends I’m still in touch with and gained really valuable experience."</i></blockquote>

    <p style = "margin-bottom: 30px;">Alicia notes that she cherish the dance club the most during this part of her life, where in which she'd meet many endearing friends.</p>

    <blockquote><i>"...I met many kind, lovely, and fun friends. Everyone approached both club activities and academics with dedication. Spending our free time rehearsing and hung out together, dancing to songs we loved, and performing on stage—those are some of my most vibrant and cherished memories of youth."</i></blockquote>
